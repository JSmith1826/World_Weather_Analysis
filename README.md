# World_Weather_Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to leverage our Python skillset to gather and analysis weather data for cities across the globe. After collecting current weather conditions (temprature, humidity, cloudiness, and humidity) the results used to populate a database and mapped using the Google Maps API. Then, based on user input, the results were filtered for optimal conditions. Google Places API was used to populate the list of cities with optimal weather with local hotels. Finally a travel itineray was created from a selected list of four possible travel destinations.
